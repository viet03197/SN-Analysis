# SN-Analysis
This is a bref analysis for a social network. The network used in this is the Facebook Large Page-Page network (available at https://snap.stanford.edu/data/facebook-large-page-page-network.html) with the Facebook pages as nodes and the mutual likes between them as edges (links).

This repository consists of a report and a jupyter notebook which was used to perform all the calculations.
